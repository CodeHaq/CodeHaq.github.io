<h2>
	THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT
</h2>
<p>
	Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
</p>

<p>
	We must clear the mind of the past.
	Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.
</p>

<p>
	The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters.
	Begin to see with clarity.
	Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion.
	Become one with the web.
</p>
